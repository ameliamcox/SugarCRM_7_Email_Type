Please assist in create customized email types

Any advice is appreciated.

I am in the process of upgrading our school (Johnson County Community College, Overland Park, KS) to Sugar 7 and I need to redo this customization that I created in the past, but was not upgrade safe. I have started the process, but I need help.

Steps needed to add customization:

1) Add business_email_c, personal_email_c and school_email_c text fields to Contact Module Form (I hope to make these hidden in the future)

2) Moves files in folder from GITREPO to your instance of Sugar 7

         custom/modules/Contacts/clients/base/fields/email

         custom/modules/Contacts/clients/base/views/record

GitHub - ameliamcox/SugarCRM_7_Email_Type: Project to create School, Personal, and Business Email Types in SugarCRM Contâ€¦ 

 

I have modified the email field in the Contact Module:
<UL>
    <LI>Added 2 additional buttons for business and personal in edit mode (edit-email-field.hbs)</LI>
    <LI>Added 3 possible labels school, business and personal in detail mode (detail.hbs)</LI>
    <LI>Added code to only let one business and one personal button to be selected, like the primary email address button (select_one_email_type.js)</LI>
    <LI>Buttons(edit view) and labels(detail view) are selected when page is rendered base off of two text field also on the form containing the emails school_email_c, business_email_c and personal_email_c field (Note: school email button is missing from edit view, because it on our system the source of record is an other application)</LI>
    <LI>Made changes to javascript to allow function that calls the handlebar edit-email-field.hbs to include business_email, personal_email, school_email, and has_email_types</LI>
</UL>

I have copied from original and customized the record view render function to:

<UL>
	<LI>Pull this.model.attributes.business_email_c, this.model.attributes.personal_email_c, this.model.attributes.school_email_c</LI>
	<LI>For each email array in this.model.attributes.email</LI>
        <UL>
		<LI>creates and sets email.has_email_types to TRUE</LI>
        	<LI>creates and sets email.school_email based on whether email.email_address === school_email (value of business_email_c text field)</LI>
        	<LI>creates and sets email.business_email based on whether email.email_address === business_email (value of personal_email_c text field)</LI>
        	<LI>creates and sets email.personal_email based on whether email.email_address === personal_email (value of school_email_c text field)</LI>
		</UL>
